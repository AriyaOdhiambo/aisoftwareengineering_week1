2. Your completion status is preserved during the session
3. Click any course to view its details again

### For Developers

#### Understanding the Data Structure

Courses are stored in a JavaScript array with this schema:

```javascript
{
    id: Number,              // Unique identifier
    title: String,           // Course name
    description: String,     // Brief description
    lessons: [               // Array of lesson objects
        {
            title: String,   // Lesson name
            duration: String // Time in minutes
        }
    ],
    completed: Boolean       // Completion status
}
```

#### Key Functions

| Function | Purpose | Returns |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `init()` | Initialize application | void |
| `renderCourses()` | Generate course cards on home page | void |
| `showCourseDetail(courseId)` | Display course detail page | void |
| `showHomePage()` | Return to course catalog | void |
| `toggleCourseCompletion()` | Mark/unmark course complete | void |

#### State Management

```javascript
let courses = [...coursesData];  // Course data array
let currentCourseId = null;      // Currently viewed course
```

---

## üé® Customization Guide

### Adding New Courses

Locate the `coursesData` array in the JavaScript section and add a new object:

```javascript
const coursesData = [
    // ... existing courses
    {
        id: 7,                    // Must be unique
        title: "Mobile App Development",
        description: "Learn to build iOS and Android apps with React Native.",
        lessons: [
            { title: "Introduction to React Native", duration: "40 min" },
            { title: "Components and Props", duration: "50 min" },
            { title: "State Management", duration: "60 min" },
            { title: "Navigation", duration: "45 min" },
            { title: "Publishing Your App", duration: "55 min" }
        ],
        completed: false
    }
];
```

### Modifying Colors

Find these CSS variables and update to your brand colors:

```css
/* Primary brand color (currently purple) */
background: #667eea;

/* Gradient background */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);

/* Success color (completion indicators) */
background: #10b981;
```

### Adjusting Layout

**Course Grid Columns**:
```css
.courses-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    /* Change 300px to adjust minimum card width */
}
```

**Maximum Container Width**:
```css
.container {
    max-width: 1200px;  /* Adjust for wider/narrower layouts */
}
```

### Typography Changes

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
    /* Replace with your preferred font stack */
}

/* Or use Google Fonts */
/* Add to <head>: */
/* <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> */
```

### Animation Speeds

```css
/* Adjust transition duration */
transition: all 0.3s ease;  /* Change 0.3s to speed up/slow down */
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Responsive Design Strategy

The platform uses a mobile-first approach with these breakpoints:

- **Mobile**: < 768px - Single column layout
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px - Two column grid
- **Desktop**: > 1024px - Three+ column grid (auto-fill)

Grid system automatically adjusts based on available space:
```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Minimal DOM Manipulation**: Batch updates when rendering courses
2. **CSS Transitions**: Hardware-accelerated transforms for smooth animations
3. **Event Delegation**: Efficient event handling for dynamic content
4. **No External Dependencies**: Zero network requests after initial load

### Browser Compatibility

**Modern Features Used**:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- ES6+ JavaScript (arrow functions, template literals, spread operator)
- CSS custom properties could be added for theming
- Transform and transition for animations

**Fallbacks**: None currently implemented. For older browser support, consider:
- Babel transpilation for JavaScript
- Autoprefixer for CSS
- Polyfills for Grid/Flexbox

### Accessibility Considerations

**Current Implementation**:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard-navigable buttons
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- Hover states provide visual feedback

**Potential Improvements**:
- Add ARIA labels and roles
- Implement keyboard navigation between courses
- Screen reader announcements for status changes
- Focus management when switching pages
